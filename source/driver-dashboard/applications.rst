Applications
============

Most Carvoyant users will end up having multiple applications that are used to interact with your car.  The Carvoyant system provides that connectivity to your car and a means for other application developers to interact with it.  This page will allow you to review who you have granted access to your car, and if necessary, revoke that access.

Please note that if your revoke access to an application, that application will no longer work until you reauthorize it from within that applications.
