Sample Integrations
===================

In this section we will periodically post how-to's for connecting the Carvoyant platform to other systems.

All of these integrations will use the Carvoyant Sandbox environment.  They all expect that the developer has created a Developer account, a Sandbox API key and a Carvoyant Sandbox User Account (with a vehicle on it).  Instructions for getting started can be found here.  Please be sure that your Sandbox environment is configured properly and that you are able to make API calls against the Carvoyant account.

SmartThings

This example integration will add your Carvoyant enabled vehicles to your SmartThings setup.  You will be able to integrate your vehicles presence as well as it's ignition state into your smart home configuration.  View the how-to :doc:`here <smartthings/smartthings>`.

Force.com

This example integration will use Vehicle location Event Subscriptions to update a map within a Force.com application.  View the how-to :doc:`here <force_com/force-com>`.
